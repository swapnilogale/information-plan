# Product walkthroughs

In order to create content for the Visual Planning help centre, we will need to schedule a few sessions of product walkthroughs. 

I suggest we record these sessions (audio/video or audio only) to act as reference for content creation.

List of areas to be covered:

* Overview of Visual Planning Tool
* How the different tabs relate to each other
* Plan tab
* Manage tab
* Forecast tab
* How does the data flow between the tabs
* Use-case scenarios (2-3 different ways this product can be used)
