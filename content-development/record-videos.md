# Record videos/animated gifs

To complement the product walkthroughs, it may be beneficial to record short 2-3 minute videos or 5-7 secs animated gifs covering different elements of the Visual Planning tool. 

These videos/animated gifs could also be used as part of the help centre and add a different way of representing information to the users.

List of possible videos/animated gifs:
* Drag and drop functionality
* Hide/display panes
* How to use search fields
* What do the icons mean?
* Color coding of resources
* Settings
* What do these fields signify? (Manage tab)
